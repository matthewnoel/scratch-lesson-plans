## Make the classic game

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801064832

First we'll make a `Ball` sprite.
At the start it should go to the center then point in a random direction.
While the game is going it should move and bounce if it hits an edge.

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
point in direction (pick random (-180) to (180))
forever
    move (5) steps
    if on edge, bounce
end
```

Next we'll make two sprites to be paddles.
The first sprite `Player` will be our player's paddle and it will move according to the mouse.
When the game starts we will put the paddle on the left side of the screen.
While the game is being played we will repeatedly set the paddle `y` position to the mouse's `y` position

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
set x to (-190)
forever
    set y to (mouse y)
end
```

The second sprite `Bot` will be our bot's paddle.
When the game start we will put the paddle on the right side of the screen.

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (190) y: (0)
```

To help the bot follow the ball we will create a variable to track the ball's position.
This variable should exist for all sprites and we will set it to the ball's `y` position when the `Ball` sprite moves.

```scratchblocks
forever
    move (5) steps
    if on edge, bounce
    set [BallY v] to (y position)
end
```

The `Bot` sprite can then follow the `Ball` sprite like so.

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (190) y: (0)
forever
    glide (0.2) secs to x: (190) y: (BallY)
end
```

We have a ball that bounces around the screen and paddles that move.
Next we need to make the ball bounce off the paddles.
Let's add a section in the `forever` block of our `Ball` sprite to point in the direction of a bounce if the ball touches either paddle.

```scratchblocks
forever
    move (5) steps
    if on edge, bounce
    if <<touching (Player v)?> or <touching (Bot v)?>> then
        point in direction ((direction) * (-1))
    end
end
```
