# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## A classic first program

In this program you will make a `sprite` say a greeting.

Add the green flag `event` block to your sprite's code.

Then add a block from the `looks` category to make the sprite say "Hello World!".

```scratchblocks[*]
when green flag clicked
say [Hello World!]
```

Great job!
