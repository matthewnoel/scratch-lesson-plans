# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## A classic first program

In this program you will make a `sprite` say hello!

Scratch programs start when the `green flag` is clicked.

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
```

Now let's make the program **do** something.

```scratchblocks[*]
when green flag clicked
say [Hello World!]
```

Great! We have:

* Added code to a sprite
* Made a sprite say a greeting

What **fun**!
