# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## A classic first program

This is a demo of the program we will make:

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/807782232/

Scratch programs start when the green flag is clicked. Place this block from the `Events` category to start your program.

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
```

Next add a block from the `Looks` category to make the sprite say "Hello World!".

```scratchblocks
when green flag clicked
say [Hello World!]
```

Great job! You've written your first program.
